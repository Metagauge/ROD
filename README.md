## METAGAUGE
MetaGauge is a project that offers innovative DApp services in the mobility data market through rewards and NFT GAME-Fi. It provides Mobility to Earn (M2E) services, where users are rewarded with points and tokens based on the distance, time, and mode of transportation such as driving, public transportation, flights, or walking, using the user's device location (GPS) data.

MetaGauge integrates key value from mobility data, including user's driving data, transportation data, and movement data, into decentralized DApp services connected with web 3.0-based location (GPS) verification Composable NFTs and blockchain security protocols.

Users can generate various types of data through MetaGauge's DApp while using different modes of transportation and environments. This data includes:

Driving data such as distance, time, frequency, and other metrics related to driving behavior like sudden accelerations, sudden decelerations, sharp turns, etc.

Movement data including departure and destination points for walking, driving, or flying.

In return for generating this data, users can receive rewards in the form of mobile coupons, shopping-exclusive points called RPM points, and utility RP (ROD token points). Additionally, users may also receive governance MP (MGR token points) rewards through NFT level-ups in the future.

Users can even earn RP and RPM rewards for activities like walking and jogging, with their location data and personal information undergoing non-identifiable encryption processing for privacy protection.

### The 3 types of point rewards provided by the MetaGauge DApp
- In both exercise modes like walking and running, and mobility modes, users can earn three types of points: RPM (ROD POINT MONEY/shopping-exclusive points), RP (ROD POINT), and MP (MetaGauge POINT).

- RPM points are limited to 100 per day, with a maximum of 5 times per day, at 1.0V.

- RP is swappable with ROD (ROAD TOKEN) tokens and serves as in-game assets within the MetaGauge ecosystem.

- MP can be swapped with MGR (MetaGauge RPM TOKEN) governance tokens and can be cashed out through exchanges. They are essential for MetaGauge NFT minting, governance participation, P2P transactions, and more.

- In the future, RP and MP, as well as ROD and MGR, will be swappable between each other.

### METAGAUGE DApp NFT
Furthermore, users can verify the generation of location data (GPS) and have the chance to acquire Composable NFTs consisting of 8 parts through "METABOX" in MetaGauge. The acquired Meta Gauge CCCP (Crypto Car Composable Part) NFTs are unique NFTs with metadata, encompassing 4 attributes: output, torque, fuel efficiency, and speed, along with 5 grades: common, rare, epic, legendary, and mystical.

Based on the rarity level, namely common (1), rare (2), epic (4), legendary (8), and mystical (16), users can enhance the mining rewards of RP (ROD token points) and MP (governance MGR token points). Users generating a significant amount of movement data (GPS) can quickly increase their "account level," symbolizing RP experience points, and assemble Parts NFTs in a DIY manner to raise the level of rarity. This method increases the mining amount of the governance token, MGR.

Only verified location (GPS) data receives token rewards and seamlessly connects to the MetaGauge location-based network. Users gain access to engaging content such as check-ins and visit missions, obtaining more utility tokens and NFT parts items.

Thus, the Composable CCCP-NFTs operating on the MetaGauge blockchain serve as decentralized validation technology for MetaGauge's pursuit of Web3.0's fundamental direction, representing the core essence of MetaGauge.

### The MetaGauge DApp-NFT and item
- The 3,000 limited-edition Genesis NFTs grant holders priority access to MetaGauge events and benefits. In the future, when the MetaGauge DAO is established, holders of Genesis NFTs may be elected as DAO members based on the quantity and duration of their holdings.

- They can then participate in shaping the vision of MetaGauge.

- CCCP-Parts NFTs are not sold by the foundation. They are generated probabilistically through "METABOX" after users verify their arrival at their destination. When "METABOX" is opened, either the three types of points or Parts can appear probabilistically. It's important to note that Parts acquired through "METABOX" are considered items, not NFTs.

- In MetaGauge DApp 1.0V, users can consume acquired RP to mint items into NFTs, supporting the transformation of items into NFTs. Additionally, when equipped in CCCP-Parts ITEM state, users can upgrade four attribute values by 30%.

- CCCP-Parts NFTs consist of eight parts items: Body, Body Kit, Engine, Booster, Spoiler, Wheel, Background, and Sticker (to be implemented in the second half of 2023).

- CCCP-NFTs can be traded on the upcoming MetaGauge NFT marketplace and will be supported for trading on NFT exchanges that deal with BNB chain NFTs.

- From CCCP-NFT attachment level 20 onwards, users can mine MGR tokens, the governance token.

### MetaGauge DApp facilitates NFT minting and token swap
- Users can validate location (GPS) data and mint items into NFTs using acquired RP points. MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this process. With just a MetaMask wallet connection, users can easily experience generating NFTs. Even without blockchain knowledge or BNB coins, anyone can acquire items and effortlessly mint NFTs for free. This initiative aims to motivate users to transition into the Web3.0 world.

- Users can easily exchange their RP for ROD tokens with just one click after validating their location (GPS) data. In version 1.0, this swap is available when users have accumulated 600 or more RP. MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this process.

- ROD tokens will be utilized in various ways within the MetaGauge ecosystem, including trading for Parts NFTs in the internal market, NFT synthesis, and other Game-Fi functionalities.

- Similarly, users can swap MP for MGR tokens with a single click, and MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this operation. MGR tokens can be cashed out on exchanges and serve as the fundamental means of payment within the MetaGauge P2P ecosystem.

- In the future, RP and MP will be swappable, as will ROD tokens and MGR tokens. However, users will be responsible for covering the gas fees for these swaps. All gas fees associated with user-to-user transactions are the responsibility of the users.

## Meta-gauge and mobility location (GPS) data
### 2-1. Mobility Location (GPS) Data Status
As of 2019, the average driving distance per car was 38.5 km, with a total mileage of 329.6 billion km for all vehicles. Seoul citizens traveled approximately 3,300 km per year using public transportation, covering about 9 km daily. Additionally, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2017, the number of air passengers exceeded 4 billion during this period.

A recent report from Morgan Stanley Investment Bank indicates that with the emergence of autonomous vehicles, the global vehicle operating time, currently at around 600 billion hours annually, is expected to increase by 25% to 750 billion hours by 2030 and potentially double by 2040. By 2030, it is estimated that people worldwide will spend 1.2 trillion hours in cars.

While individuals continue to generate mobility data, most data producers are unaware of its importance and merely consume it. Users of large platforms consistently provide valuable location data, including travel routes, yet individuals, as data generators, do not receive any benefits. Conversely, giant capitals building platforms accumulate vast wealth in related industries based on these individuals' mobility and location data.

However, given the rising importance of mobility data as a big issue in modern society, various approaches and sharing methods for individual data security and ownership are being proposed, particularly among traditional mobility industry leaders. For instance, Ford in the United States has launched two data products that provide easier access to data collected through vehicles. These products allow access to location, mileage, fuel usage data, and driver behavior, among other behavioral data points.

The Korea Transport Institute (KOTI), a public institution in Korea, is making efforts to integrate data from various fields through its Mobility Big Data Center to enhance more efficient management. To achieve this, it aims to integrate and manage transportation-related big data, which are currently fragmented by sector, for problem-solving and decision-making purposes. This includes integrating and correlating various mobile big data such as vehicle navigation data, mobile communication data, and public transportation card data, as well as multi-faceted transportation data such as autonomous driving, logistics, aviation, and the national transportation database (국가교통DB). By providing integrated and interconnected transportation big data, KOTI aims to enhance accessibility and convenience for users in accessing mobility data.

Global automobile manufacturers and public institutions are competitively entering the mobility data industry to preempt the enormous amount of big data expected to emerge in the future mobility industry. They are focusing on various attempts to integrate data for future mobility core technologies such as autonomous driving, eco-friendliness, urban air mobility, digital twins, high-definition maps, etc., and are also positioning themselves to enter related businesses.

As seen in various cases, the potential for utilizing mobility data is expected to innovatively transform mobility life thus far. Alongside this, the exponential growth in the generation of mobility data and issues such as ownership, compensation, and trustworthiness of data are currently more critical than ever.

However, the current mobility data market heavily relies on traditional methods of data collection (e.g., OBD) and largely excludes aspects related to ownership and compensation for individual data generators. While various proposals and solutions from startups and academia are being attempted, the reality is that challenges such as efficient value proposition and compensation to users due to data collection, ownership division, sharing, and authenticity issues have led to a stagnation in the web 2.0 era.

Therefore, MetaGauge is collecting and analyzing mobility data from three major perspectives by connecting to a blockchain network based on user-centered mobility location (GPS) data in the future. It is a decentralized location-based (GPS) data company that integrates and collects various types of data, including travel data such as distance traveled, travel time, and frequency of travel; driving data such as sudden acceleration, sudden deceleration, and sharp turns; and mobility data such as origin, destination, mode of transportation (e.g., walking, car, airplane).

Users can establish ownership of their data on the blockchain web 3.0-based platform through unique Composable-NFTs acquired through real GPS data verification.

Various forms of Mobility to Earn, based on acquired NFTs, are implemented as location-based (GPS) data content linked to both the physical and virtual worlds (Land). Users profit by owning data generated through actual movement in the virtual world as well.

Through MetaGauge's diverse metaverse platforms, users can expand their mobility location (GPS) data generated in real life, allowing anyone to create content based on mobility location (GPS) data without boundaries between online and offline.

In this ecosystem of Composable-NFTs based on blockchain web 3.0 for mobility location (GPS) data, users are ensured monetary rewards and exclusive ownership rights for the new value of their created data through DIY NFTs. They can also monetize the collected information by trading various assets such as NFTs and ITEMS on the market within the MetaGauge ecosystem.

Especially, by connecting to integrated mobility location (GPS) data that will be utilized in various industries such as insurance, logistics, finance, and automotive services, users can experience shared connections based on their real-world travel data, leading to connectivity to MetaGauge's offered metaverse (Land).

## 2-2. Changes in Integrated Mobility Location (GPS) Based Data
Experts predict that the future development direction of the market utilizing mobility location (GPS) data will evolve further in areas such as autonomous driving, eco-friendliness, urban air mobility, and ICT. It is expected that "door-to-door" autonomous vehicles, capable of driving from pick-up to drop-off, will become commonplace, and it will be possible to commute by flying through the sky to predetermined destinations using various GPS data.

Moreover, individuals will experience innovative mobility environments, different from the past, where they can control various household electronic devices and enjoy movies within vehicles. Throughout this process, a vast amount of big data will be generated.

In particular, mobility location-based (GPS) data is expected to evolve into a technology that enables sharing and experiences through blockchain-connected big data, as well as connections between reality and virtual worlds. It will converge with AI big data-based digital integrated mobility, such as micro-mobility connecting bicycles and shared kick scooters, autonomous vehicles, and urban air mobility, leading to a complete transformation of individuals' lifestyles.

Location-based (GPS) mobility data is the most crucial element in related industries, but it is realistically challenging for individuals to process and own vast amounts of data.

From the perspective of companies paying for utilization, unverified data is not trustworthy. Therefore, to address issues related to ownership, security, and privacy protection, there has been consideration of applying blockchain technology. This would enable secure handling of data while ensuring privacy, allowing for the interconnection of each data on a user device-based GPS mobility data platform like MetaGauge.

### 2-3. Transformation of Mobility Data Value
Transformation of Multi-Mobility Big Data, interlinked with fields such as autonomous driving, urban air mobility, and smart cities, is poised to become the lifeblood of future industries. The evaluation, translated into the mobility service value of the automotive industry, stands at an astonishing 7,000 trillion won.

In the future, mobility big data is expected to bring about disruptive innovation in traditional mobility industries. MetaGauge aims to break down the boundaries between mobility industries through rewards and NFT GAME-Fi based on user location (GPS) data. It will pioneer business innovation in convergence and blockchain technology, leading to a complete overhaul of the multi-mobility ecosystem.

1. MaaS (Mobility as a Service): This term refers to a new mobility service that integrates information on various modes of transportation such as buses, taxis, and shared vehicles to provide users with the optimal route. Similar to transferring between buses and subways with a transit card, MaaS allows users to conveniently access both traditional modes of transportation and shared services through a single integrated platform.

1. LaaS (Logistics as a Service): LaaS can be defined as a platform that arranges the delivery of food or the transportation of goods, in addition to human mobility, and can be utilized as a service.

1. TaaS (Transportation as a Service): TaaS is a concept that combines MaaS and LaaS. It is a higher-level concept that encompasses not only human mobility but also the movement of logistics. TaaS can be understood as mobility being utilized in various ways depending on the purpose, such as providing flexible services for both human and logistical movement.

## The token economy and ecosystem of MetaGauge
The MetaGauge ecosystem operates with two tokens: the utility token 'ROD' and the governance token 'MGR'. The utility token, obtained solely through user location-based (GPS) mobility data, operates as a 100% mineable token with no issuance limit.

The utility ROD token will serve as the foundational token within the MetaGauge ecosystem, utilized for Composable-NFTs, Game-Fi, and the platform's internal marketplace.

The MGR token allows users to access the MetaGauge marketplace with reduced fees based on their holding amount and lock-up period. Additionally, users can enhance their mining power for the utility token through various means such as different modes of transportation, distances traveled, time spent, frequency of travel, speed, and input of origin and destination, thereby acquiring more ROD tokens, MGR tokens, and Parts NFTs.

Composable-NFT holders in the MetaGauge ecosystem will have priority participation rights in governance land ownership, centered around landmarks worldwide. Landowners in the virtual world will be able to generate revenue by creating various game module contents based on real-world location (GPS) data and trading them on the marketplace. They can also earn module usage fees from participants, provide challenges such as campaigns to participants within their virtual world, or generate revenue by renting out Parts-Items to others through the "certified rental operator system."

For instance, users can purchase NFT car racing track modules proportional to the distance covered by real-world location (GPS) data and organize car races, or offer various challenges such as campaigns to participants within the metaverse. Users can also monetize by exposing advertisements on objects such as roads and buildings along their real-world location (GPS) data movement paths. Certified rental users holding several high-rarity Parts-Items can earn rental fees by renting them out to users with longer travel distances. Overall, MetaGauge aims to create an innovative integrated mobility data ecosystem accessible to everyone through Mobility to Earn, based on Web 3.0 technology.

MetaGauge plans to implement a unique E-Commerce platform based on mobility location (GPS) data, connecting it to real-world Mobility after Market sectors such as automotive accessories, car wash, and maintenance. This will be a core business implementation within MetaGauge's token economy.

In particular, the Composable-Parts NFTs, validated through MetaGauge's Web 3.0-based GPS data verification method, will become key assets in the future TaaS (Transportation as a Service) business ecosystem that MetaGauge aims to establish. Parts-NFT and MGR token holders can generate revenue through peer-to-peer delivery transactions in real life, sell products and services in the metaverse, or connect to innovative P2P E-Commerce platforms for delivery and storage.

MetaGauge DApp services are poised to grow into an integrated mobility location (GPS) data platform where global users can engage. Users will be able to input their mobility data directly, including origin, destination, waypoints, and mode of transportation, and share it with other users on the platform, thus instantly connecting globally 24/7 through the TaaS ecosystem.

In this scenario, users wishing to travel through mobility will be automatically matched with logistics data to perform delivery, generating additional income through delivery fees in MGR tokens. They can also acquire achievement boxes at their destination, create limited edition Parts Items, and experience special Web 3.0 experiences.

The MetaGauge ecosystem aims to prioritize user engagement in daily activities closely related to mobility through "Mobility to Earn." Users will experience remarkable economic incentives based on their contributions to the ecosystem and the CCCP-NFTs utilizing MetaGauge's blockchain-based Web 3.0 GPS data verification technology.

## Mobility to Earn
MetaGauge is a platform that provides the "Mobility to Earn" service, integrating users' driving data, vehicle operation data, and movement data to ensure ownership rights and enable fair compensation. MetaGauge is committed to Web 3.0 principles, allowing users to freely generate data and participate in the governance ecosystem by receiving tokens as fair compensation. Through MetaGauge's DApp, users can generate driving data such as distance, duration, and frequency, as well as movement data such as origin and destination, to earn RP points. Additionally, users can acquire 8 different PARTS-ITEMs based on their data generation volume and ecosystem contribution. These acquired PARTS-ITEMs have varying attributes and rarity based on their grade. Users can assemble PARTS-ITEMs in a composable manner to create their unique NFTs. The level of these NFTs influences the reward limit of MP points. Various events and destination missions provide additional opportunities for users to earn more RP points and acquire PARTS-ITEMs.

## METAGAUGE Game-Fi
MetaGauge offers three user modes that are open to everyone. Among them, the Daily Mode is a service where users can receive dedicated RPM POINTs used for gifts, shopping, and more.

MetaGauge has devised various reward mechanisms to make it easy and simple for Web 2.0 users to experience Web 3.0 while continuously using the platform through the Daily Mode. Even users who are unfamiliar with Gas Fees will be able to enjoy a new experience of creating ITEMs as NFTs for free through the Daily Mode. MetaGauge believes that this will increase the natural influx of users to Web 3.0.

### Daily mode
#### Daily Mode users can earn RPM and RP points as rewards for their walking/running data!
- Daily Mode users can earn 20 RPM as a reward each time they generate walking data, with a limit of 100 RPM per day, capped at 5 times a day in version 1.0. This limit may be subject to change based on future Daily Mode operating policies.

- If a user only generates one walking data entry per day, they will receive one 20 RPM reward point through the "Point Acquisition" button. In this case, the user can complete Daily Missions or other content to accumulate the remaining 4 RPM points.

- In the future, users may choose to convert their accumulated points through walking data generation into RP. In this scenario, the maximum amount of RP points that can be earned is capped at 10 RP, subject to potential changes in MetaGauge's operating policies.

- The 100 points earned from 5 sessions per day can be converted into 100 Korean won and redeemed for gift coupons and shopping items. This redemption policy may also be subject to change based on future Daily Mode operating policies.

- When the "Point Accumulation" button for RPM rewards in Daily Mode is clicked, a video advertisement will play. After the completion of the advertisement, users must click the "Accumulation Button" to receive the points.

#### RPM points are dedicated points used for coffee, convenience store purchases, mobile coupons, shopping, and more!
- It can be exchanged for various items such as convenience store items, bakery goods, pizza, movie tickets, mobile vouchers, and more.

- In the future, it will also be exchangeable for a variety of shopping products and services including health supplements and automotive accessories.

#### After version 1.0, users will be able to earn RPM points through even more diverse daily missions!
- We plan to introduce new and fresh daily missions such as Daily Quiz, Daily Likes, Daily Challenges, Daily Draw, Daily Visits, and more, to open up additional ways to earn rewards.

- If you have any suggestions or questions regarding the Daily Mode, please feel free to contact our customer support center at any time via email at contact@metagauge.io.

#### _Policy guide for using the Daily Mode_
- When using the Daily Mode, it is necessary to grant all the recommended permissions as suggested by the MetaGauge DApp.

- The MetaGauge DApp automatically detects user movement and starts rewarding users with rewards proportional to their location (GPS) data when they reach a certain speed. Users must set their location information to "Always Allow" for background operation.

- The quantity of RPM rewards may be subject to changes such as the daily accumulation frequency, quantity, or suspension of RPM reward policies according to MetaGauge's operational policies. In such cases, advance notice will be provided.

- RPM rewards are reset at 24:00 KST (Korean Standard Time) every day.

- Devices that do not support RPM point rewards may have restrictions on using this Daily Mode.

- The Daily Mode can be used concurrently with other modes.

### RP mode
RP(ROD TOKEN POINT) 모드 소개

#### RP Mode users can earn RP points as rewards for using walking/running data!
- While logged into the MetaGauge DApp, users can earn RP separately from mobile coupons and shopping-exclusive RPM points based on GPS data of over 1km.

- There are no separate eligibility criteria for RP Mode and Daily Mode, and users can engage in overlapping activities.

- RP Mode rewards users with RP points based on their frequent and extensive generation of GPS data. As users accumulate more RP experience through distance traveled and the frequency of movement, they can increase their "account level" through an algorithm, earning more RP (swappable to ROD tokens).

- Users can acquire MetaGauge's Parts Item through check-ins, daily missions, various events, etc. Equipping acquired Parts Items can enhance MetaGauge's four attributes – power (GC), fuel efficiency (FE), durability (ST), etc., leveling up the RP reward amount.

- RP rewards are reset at 06:00 KST the following day.

- RP and ROD tokens are interchangeable at a 1:1 ratio.

#### ROD TOKEN(Meta Gauge Utility Token)
- ROD token serves as the utility token within the MetaGauge ecosystem, functioning as the core token in all Game-Fi activities.

- Users can earn RP (exchangeable 1:1 with ROD TOKEN) by generating their GPS data through various means of movement such as walking, public transportation, or driving, and increasing their level based on distance, time, speed, frequency, etc.

- Token Name: ROD TOKEN

- Token Ticker: ROD Contract Address: 0x419CA793d74cc8d22535BCF611eFC134f7136731

- Total Supply: Unlimited The issuance of ROD tokens is unlimited, but to prevent inflation, the issuance is restricted on a yearly, monthly, and daily basis.

- The annual issuance of ROD tokens cannot exceed three times the annual supply of governance MGR tokens, designed to suppress the rapid inflation of utility ROD tokens.

- Monthly and daily issuance of ROD tokens occurs within the annual issuance limit, and any unsupplied ROD tokens due to a low number of initial users accumulate in the storage pool.

- It's important to note that actual ROD tokens are not accumulated in the storage pool; instead, RP is stored.

- Accumulated RP in the storage pool is used for additional rewards when there's deflation due to an increase in users, when the later supply decreases by more than 30% compared to the initial supply, or when the reward amount for user account levels decreases by more than 30%. 

- Additionally, it may be supplied to compensate for significantly lower rewards for later users compared to initial users.

#### ROD TOKEN Burn address
So far, many X-to-Earn projects have failed to achieve a sustainable revenue structure. To-earn projects have initially minted NFTs that could be considered as mining utilities tokens for initial development and operational funds, or to portray the project's success externally. Mining NFTs for early users have resulted in a boomerang effect, leading to a decline in utility token prices and accompanying NFT depreciation.

MetaGauge refrains from selling NFTs that mine utility tokens initially to experiment with various options and solutions to prevent inflation of utility tokens. Additionally, we have devised various burn addresses as outlined below, and will continue to research and develop utility burn addresses. In the future, MetaGauge DAO will generate more experimental and innovative burn structures through voting.

- Parts-NFT minting fee

- Parts-NFT synthesis fee

- In-house Parts NFT marketplace fee

- Fuel refill fee

- RP-ROD swap fee

- MP-MGR swap fee

- RP-MP, MP-RP swap fee

- ROD-MGR, MGR-ROD swap fee

- Various burn systems such as multi-occurrence

- MetaBoxes in Game-Fi

- Ad pass rights, protection rights, and various other burn systems will be disclosed in the future.

#### ROD TOKEN & RP(ROD POINT)
2-1) Policies regarding the RP mode users

- The MetaGauge ecosystem is designed around increasing rewards in ROD and MGR tokens as users generate more location (GPS) data through their movement. It is structured to allow users to earn more tokens and NFT items as they accumulate "experience" through their GPS data. This decentralized "Mobility to Earn" model integrates Game-Fi where NFTs are generated and assembled using users' GPS data, creating a web2.3.0 hybrid experience.

- MetaGauge DApp users can access all three modes regardless of their NFT holdings or activity range. Users can generate GPS data for all types of mobility and movements, including walking, public transportation, driving, and flying, and receive rewards in the form of RPM, RP, and MP points. Here are the user policies for earning RP rewards

- Incorporate additional reward weighting for users who generate a large amount of MetaGauge's three integrated mobility GPS data: driving data, travel data, and movement data.

- Design an algorithm to convert driving data into scores and apply additional reward weighting accordingly.

- Develop an algorithm to reward users who input departure, destination, waypoints, etc., for movement data, in addition to generating GPS data.

- Design an algorithm where users contributing more to the MetaGauge ecosystem receive additional reward weighting. This could include factors such as friend referrals, in-app activities, and account-level weighting linked to GPS data generation metrics.

- Implement an algorithm where reward weighting increases based on the "CCCP-ITEM level," a scale representing the user's activity and contribution within the MetaGauge DApp. This weighting could increase based on three attributes: output, efficiency, and other abilities related to the CCCP-ITEM level.

- Design an algorithm to address RP deflation scenarios, where the amount of RP rewards decreases based on account level. In such cases, calculate the reduction amount based on the average of users with higher RP reward experience within the daily, monthly, and yearly RP issuance limits, distributing the reduction equitably among affected users.

2-2) Parameters for RP Reward Engagement Mode:

- Distance traveled, number of trips, etc. - driving data

- Equipped inventory item "output" and "efficiency" attributes

- Rarity and quantity of Parts Items owned (to be applied in the future)

- Quantity of Genesis NFTs owned (to be applied in the future)

- Travel time, average speed, etc. - driving data (to be applied in the future)

- Data on sudden acceleration, sudden deceleration, sharp turns, etc. - driving data (to be applied in the future)

- Departure point, destination, waypoints, etc. - movement data (to be applied in the future)

- Weighted rewards for manual start and manual end (to be applied in the future) Fuel consumption rate

__* Notice: Detailed policies and implementation dates for the storage pool will be disclosed at a later date, and policies are subject to change or modification based on updates to the whitepaper.*__

### MP mode
#### MP mode users can earn MP points as rewards by generating GPS data for all types of transportation usage, starting from Parts-NFT level 20 users!

- The MP mode is available only to users with CCCP-Parts NFT account level 20 or higher. In the MP mode, users can earn two types of rewards, MP (MGR TOKEN POINT) and RP (ROD TOKEN POINT), by generating mobility GPS data.

- MP users can generate GPS data and use the Parts-items obtained as rewards to mint NFTs using the RP they have earned (applied in 1.0V). By upgrading the Parts-NFT grade and increasing the values of four attributes including output, torque, fuel efficiency, and Santa, through the NFT leveling up algorithm, users can acquire more MP (swappable for MGR tokens).

- Users can obtain MetaGauge's Parts Items through activities such as check-ins, daily missions, ranking systems, lotto raffles, etc. Additionally, users can purchase Parts-NFTs with attributes suitable for their activity range from the NFT market to increase their grade and NFT level.

- MP and MGR TOKEN are swappable at a 1:1 ratio, and MGR and ROD are also swappable.

- Mining rewards for MP start from NFT level 20 or higher, but there is a daily mining reward limit for each NFT level.

#### Sharing Mode" (Peer-to-Peer global feature/ to be disclosed later)
The "Sharing Mode" is a service that allows users to immediately connect their product deliveries to similar destinations by sharing destinations with other Meta Gauge DAPP users. Users can contribute to environmental protection by saving the distance of separately delivered products through sharing deliveries with other users in similar directions, thus reducing carbon emissions. Users participating in deliveries may receive more RP or MP token mining rewards compared to regular users and can convert reduced carbon footprints into credits.

In addition, users of the Sharing Mode are KYC-verified individuals. They are granted the Santa Patch provided to top governance members and belong to the upper echelons of Meta Gauge certification levels. In essence, the Sharing Mode is an authenticated mode where users share destination information and participate in P2P global delivery for higher mining rewards.

After sharing destination information, users can record their driving records. At the same time, the Meta Gauge DAPP automatically generates daily driving memos by recording driving distance, time, and speed.

Santa-certified users can automatically receive membership discounts when using the Meta Gauge NFT marketplace. Santa-certified users can also have the highest authentication privileges as contributors to the Meta Gauge ecosystem's governance. The Sharing Mode will become the cornerstone of Meta Gauge's core business model.

### PARTS NFT
#### Attributes of NFT
- "Generating capacity" represents the power of the NFT engine, indicating the ability to mine more ROD tokens. Higher generating capacity allows users to reach their daily mining limits more quickly, even with shorter distances traveled. This attribute is advantageous for users with shorter daily distances.

- "Torque" represents the instantaneous speed power of the NFT, indicating the ability to mine more MP tokens. Higher torque allows for more efficient mining of MP tokens. Mining of MGR tokens is possible for NFTs of epic grade or higher.

- "Fuel efficiency" refers to the ability to reduce the rate at which fuel decreases during RP mining. This attribute helps maintain a certain fuel efficiency ratio relative to output. It is advantageous for users with long daily distances.

- "Santa" influences all probabilities within the DApp. By increasing the enhancement probability of NFT Parts, it allows users to receive higher-level NFT Parts Airdrops.

#### NFT PARTS
NFT PARTS have an NFT LEVEL for each grade. The attributes granted for each grade are randomized.
|TIER|NFT LEVEL|Give to ability|Ability(min-max)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Common|1|Get 1 GC|8-16|
|Rare|2|Get 1 GC and Get 1 of FE, ST, TQ|8-16|
|Epik|4|Get 3 of GC, FE, ST, TQ|10-21|
|Legendary|8|Get all GC, FE, ST, TQ|16-32|
|Mystic|16|Get all GC, FE, ST, TQ|32-64|

Users can acquire a total of 8 NFT PARTS components. If all 8 PARTS are Mystic, the NFT LEVEL will be 128.

## Other systems of MetaGauge
### Automatic Start/Stop System
The Meta Gauge DApp automatically starts when the vehicle is traveling at over 15 km/h and automatically stops when it has been traveling at speeds below 10 km/h for 10 minutes. In the case of exercise mode, users can manually start it, and even if they do not manually stop it after the exercise is complete, it will be automatically stopped.

### Meta Gauge Fuel System
Users receive RP mining rewards through the generation of mobility and exercise location (GPS) data in the Meta Gauge DApp. Similar to how fuel is consumed when driving or using mobility in the real world, users consume fuel proportionate to the amount of RP rewards mined. Users can spend the rewarded RP to recharge their fuel.

In the future, if the fuel level drops below 90%, the amount of RP rewards will decrease. The fuel decrease rate is calculated based on the status at 06:00 AM the next day. Users need to ensure that their fuel does not drop below 90% by 06:00 AM the next day.

#### When refueling, the deduction in RP reward amount is as follows.
- When the fuel is below 90%, the RP reward amount decreases by 10%.

- When the fuel is below 80%, the RP reward amount decreases by 20%.

- When the fuel is below 50%, the RP reward amount decreases by 50%.

- When the fuel is at 30%, the RP reward amount decreases by 80%.

- When the fuel is at 10%, the RP reward amount decreases by 90%.

∎ Fuel replenishment will be made possible through advertisements and participation in ad campaigns.

#### The refueling cost is as follows.
- When the fuel is above 80%, deduct 15% of the daily account reward and recharge to 100%.

- When the fuel is above 50%, deduct 20% of the daily account reward and recharge to 100%.

- When the fuel is above 20%, deduct 30% of the daily account reward and recharge to 100%.

- When the fuel is below or equal to 20%, deduct 40% of the daily account reward and recharge to 100%.

- When the fuel is at 0%, deduct 50% of the daily mining reward and recharge to 100%.

∎ The above fuel recharge policy applies only if recharged before 6 AM the next day.

∎ You can recharge the fuel to 100% before 6 AM the next day.

∎ During the initial 1.0V Open Beta Testing (OBT), fuel will be fully recharged for free every Monday at 6:00 AM. After the initial period of user adaptation during the 1.0V OBT, the fuel policy outlined in the whitepaper will be implemented, with announcements made accordingly.

### Meta Gauge Level System
Meta Gauge DApp features a function to increase the account level. The daily maximum RP reward limit is set based on the Meta Gauge account level. Account level-up is possible based on the RP reward amount. RP amount within Meta Gauge serves as experience points. There are levels up to 60, where at level 60, you can receive up to 802 RP rewards per day. As the Meta Gauge account level increases, there is a certain probability that the rarity and quantity of acquired boxes will increase.

**&#42;Decay Settings**: Every 2 years, the MP reward amount decreases by half. The RP experience reward amount varies depending on the ability value of NFT PARTS, and the daily maximum reward quantity of RP is determined based on the Meta Gauge DApp account level.

## Token Nomics
METAGAUGE TOKEN
When using the MetaGauge DAPP, users can receive rewards in the form of ROD tokens and MGR tokens through mining by generating mobility location (GPS) data. ROD tokens and MGR tokens are swapped interchangeably. The swapping ratio fluctuates based on their respective values.

### ROD TOKEN
Users can receive ROD tokens as rewards based on their "account level" while generating location (GPS) data. ROD tokens serve as the utility token for MetaGauge and can be swapped for RP points at a 1:1 ratio. RP points can also be purchased in-app and ROD tokens will be listed on DEX exchanges for trading.

### MGR TOKEN
Users can receive MGR tokens as rewards starting from account level 20 of their 'Parts NFT level' by generating location (GPS) data. MGR tokens serve as the governance token of MetaGauge, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. MGR tokens can be swapped for MP points received as rewards at a 1:1 ratio.

## Token distribution

### MGR Governance Token
▪ The MGR token is the governance token of MetaGauge, incentivizing community participation and shared vision among members of the MetaGauge ecosystem.

▪ MetaGauge community members can earn MGR tokens based on their NFT level and grade, which are determined by their movement through walking, public transportation, driving, etc., and the corresponding GPS data. Users rewarded with MGR tokens play a vital role as core members of the MetaGauge community, participating in the community's growth and governance votes to help shape its vision.

## Teams
> The MetaGauge team was formed during the development of the Pear2Pear Global Shipping DApp and also during the pivot to the "Mobility to Earn" project, which focuses on enhancing user mobility location (GPS) data!
 

MetaGauge has reviewed the technical development of a user device-based mobility location (GPS) data platform applying blockchain technology to users' mobility data, ensuring security and privacy while enabling interconnection of each data.

MetaGauge aims to redefine the blockchain technology value chain through Reward, NFT, and Game-Fi based on user location (GPS) data, breaking the boundaries between the mobility industry and interpreting the TaaS ecosystem. By providing NFT Game-Fi as a reward for data generation, MetaGauge enables users to produce sustainable mobility location (GPS) data without reluctance, paving the way for the creation of a completely new multi-mobility location (GPS) ecosystem in the future.
