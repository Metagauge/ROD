## METAGAUGE
MetaGauge is a project that offers innovative DApp services in the mobility data market through rewards and NFT GAME-Fi. It provides Mobility to Earn (M2E) services, where users are rewarded with points and tokens based on the distance, time, and mode of transportation such as driving, public transportation, flights, or walking, using the user's device location (GPS) data.

MetaGauge integrates key value from mobility data, including user's driving data, transportation data, and movement data, into decentralized DApp services connected with web 3.0-based location (GPS) verification Composable NFTs and blockchain security protocols.

Users can generate various types of data through MetaGauge's DApp while using different modes of transportation and environments. This data includes:

Driving data such as distance, time, frequency, and other metrics related to driving behavior like sudden accelerations, sudden decelerations, sharp turns, etc.

Movement data including departure and destination points for walking, driving, or flying.

In return for generating this data, users can receive rewards in the form of mobile coupons, shopping-exclusive points called RPM points, and utility RP (ROD token points). Additionally, users may also receive governance MP (MGR token points) rewards through NFT level-ups in the future.

Users can even earn RP and RPM rewards for activities like walking and jogging, with their location data and personal information undergoing non-identifiable encryption processing for privacy protection.

### The 3 types of point rewards provided by the MetaGauge DApp
- In both exercise modes like walking and running, and mobility modes, users can earn three types of points: RPM (ROD POINT MONEY/shopping-exclusive points), RP (ROD POINT), and MP (MetaGauge POINT).

- RPM points are limited to 100 per day, with a maximum of 5 times per day, at 1.0V.

- RP is swappable with ROD (ROAD TOKEN) tokens and serves as in-game assets within the MetaGauge ecosystem.

- MP can be swapped with MGR (MetaGauge RPM TOKEN) governance tokens and can be cashed out through exchanges. They are essential for MetaGauge NFT minting, governance participation, P2P transactions, and more.

- In the future, RP and MP, as well as ROD and MGR, will be swappable between each other.

### METAGAUGE DApp NFT
Furthermore, users can verify the generation of location data (GPS) and have the chance to acquire Composable NFTs consisting of 8 parts through "METABOX" in MetaGauge. The acquired Meta Gauge CCCP (Crypto Car Composable Part) NFTs are unique NFTs with metadata, encompassing 4 attributes: output, torque, fuel efficiency, and speed, along with 5 grades: common, rare, epic, legendary, and mystical.

Based on the rarity level, namely common (1), rare (2), epic (4), legendary (8), and mystical (16), users can enhance the mining rewards of RP (ROD token points) and MP (governance MGR token points). Users generating a significant amount of movement data (GPS) can quickly increase their "account level," symbolizing RP experience points, and assemble Parts NFTs in a DIY manner to raise the level of rarity. This method increases the mining amount of the governance token, MGR.

Only verified location (GPS) data receives token rewards and seamlessly connects to the MetaGauge location-based network. Users gain access to engaging content such as check-ins and visit missions, obtaining more utility tokens and NFT parts items.

Thus, the Composable CCCP-NFTs operating on the MetaGauge blockchain serve as decentralized validation technology for MetaGauge's pursuit of Web3.0's fundamental direction, representing the core essence of MetaGauge.

### The MetaGauge DApp-NFT and item
- The 3,000 limited-edition Genesis NFTs grant holders priority access to MetaGauge events and benefits. In the future, when the MetaGauge DAO is established, holders of Genesis NFTs may be elected as DAO members based on the quantity and duration of their holdings.

- They can then participate in shaping the vision of MetaGauge.

- CCCP-Parts NFTs are not sold by the foundation. They are generated probabilistically through "METABOX" after users verify their arrival at their destination. When "METABOX" is opened, either the three types of points or Parts can appear probabilistically. It's important to note that Parts acquired through "METABOX" are considered items, not NFTs.

- In MetaGauge DApp 1.0V, users can consume acquired RP to mint items into NFTs, supporting the transformation of items into NFTs. Additionally, when equipped in CCCP-Parts ITEM state, users can upgrade four attribute values by 30%.

- CCCP-Parts NFTs consist of eight parts items: Body, Body Kit, Engine, Booster, Spoiler, Wheel, Background, and Sticker (to be implemented in the second half of 2023).

- CCCP-NFTs can be traded on the upcoming MetaGauge NFT marketplace and will be supported for trading on NFT exchanges that deal with BNB chain NFTs.

- From CCCP-NFT attachment level 20 onwards, users can mine MGR tokens, the governance token.

### MetaGauge DApp facilitates NFT minting and token swap
- Users can validate location (GPS) data and mint items into NFTs using acquired RP points. MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this process. With just a MetaMask wallet connection, users can easily experience generating NFTs. Even without blockchain knowledge or BNB coins, anyone can acquire items and effortlessly mint NFTs for free. This initiative aims to motivate users to transition into the Web3.0 world.

- Users can easily exchange their RP for ROD tokens with just one click after validating their location (GPS) data. In version 1.0, this swap is available when users have accumulated 600 or more RP. MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this process.

- ROD tokens will be utilized in various ways within the MetaGauge ecosystem, including trading for Parts NFTs in the internal market, NFT synthesis, and other Game-Fi functionalities.

- Similarly, users can swap MP for MGR tokens with a single click, and MetaGauge covers the gas fees for this operation. MGR tokens can be cashed out on exchanges and serve as the fundamental means of payment within the MetaGauge P2P ecosystem.

- In the future, RP and MP will be swappable, as will ROD tokens and MGR tokens. However, users will be responsible for covering the gas fees for these swaps. All gas fees associated with user-to-user transactions are the responsibility of the users.

## Token Nomics
METAGAUGE TOKEN
When using the MetaGauge DAPP, users can receive rewards in the form of ROD tokens and MGR tokens through mining by generating mobility location (GPS) data. ROD tokens and MGR tokens are swapped interchangeably. The swapping ratio fluctuates based on their respective values.

### ROD TOKEN
Users can receive ROD tokens as rewards based on their "account level" while generating location (GPS) data. ROD tokens serve as the utility token for MetaGauge and can be swapped for RP points at a 1:1 ratio. RP points can also be purchased in-app and ROD tokens will be listed on DEX exchanges for trading.

### MGR TOKEN
Users can receive MGR tokens as rewards starting from account level 20 of their 'Parts NFT level' by generating location (GPS) data. MGR tokens serve as the governance token of MetaGauge, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. MGR tokens can be swapped for MP points received as rewards at a 1:1 ratio.

## Token distribution

### MGR Governance Token
▪ The MGR token is the governance token of MetaGauge, incentivizing community participation and shared vision among members of the MetaGauge ecosystem.

▪ MetaGauge community members can earn MGR tokens based on their NFT level and grade, which are determined by their movement through walking, public transportation, driving, etc., and the corresponding GPS data. Users rewarded with MGR tokens play a vital role as core members of the MetaGauge community, participating in the community's growth and governance votes to help shape its vision.

## Teams
> The MetaGauge team was formed during the development of the Pear2Pear Global Shipping DApp and also during the pivot to the "Mobility to Earn" project, which focuses on enhancing user mobility location (GPS) data!
 

MetaGauge has reviewed the technical development of a user device-based mobility location (GPS) data platform applying blockchain technology to users' mobility data, ensuring security and privacy while enabling interconnection of each data.

MetaGauge aims to redefine the blockchain technology value chain through Reward, NFT, and Game-Fi based on user location (GPS) data, breaking the boundaries between the mobility industry and interpreting the TaaS ecosystem. By providing NFT Game-Fi as a reward for data generation, MetaGauge enables users to produce sustainable mobility location (GPS) data without reluctance, paving the way for the creation of a completely new multi-mobility location (GPS) ecosystem in the future.
