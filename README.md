## Token Nomics
METAGAUGE TOKEN
When using the MetaGauge DAPP, users can receive rewards in the form of ROD tokens and MGR tokens through mining by generating mobility location (GPS) data. ROD tokens and MGR tokens are swapped interchangeably. The swapping ratio fluctuates based on their respective values.

### ROD TOKEN
Users can receive ROD tokens as rewards based on their "account level" while generating location (GPS) data. ROD tokens serve as the utility token for MetaGauge and can be swapped for RP points at a 1:1 ratio. RP points can also be purchased in-app and ROD tokens will be listed on DEX exchanges for trading.

### MGR TOKEN
Users can receive MGR tokens as rewards starting from account level 20 of their 'Parts NFT level' by generating location (GPS) data. MGR tokens serve as the governance token of MetaGauge, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. MGR tokens can be swapped for MP points received as rewards at a 1:1 ratio.

## Token distribution

### MGR Governance Token
▪ The MGR token is the governance token of MetaGauge, incentivizing community participation and shared vision among members of the MetaGauge ecosystem.

▪ MetaGauge community members can earn MGR tokens based on their NFT level and grade, which are determined by their movement through walking, public transportation, driving, etc., and the corresponding GPS data. Users rewarded with MGR tokens play a vital role as core members of the MetaGauge community, participating in the community's growth and governance votes to help shape its vision.

## Teams
> The MetaGauge team was formed during the development of the Pear2Pear Global Shipping DApp and also during the pivot to the "Mobility to Earn" project, which focuses on enhancing user mobility location (GPS) data!
 

MetaGauge has reviewed the technical development of a user device-based mobility location (GPS) data platform applying blockchain technology to users' mobility data, ensuring security and privacy while enabling interconnection of each data.

MetaGauge aims to redefine the blockchain technology value chain through Reward, NFT, and Game-Fi based on user location (GPS) data, breaking the boundaries between the mobility industry and interpreting the TaaS ecosystem. By providing NFT Game-Fi as a reward for data generation, MetaGauge enables users to produce sustainable mobility location (GPS) data without reluctance, paving the way for the creation of a completely new multi-mobility location (GPS) ecosystem in the future.
